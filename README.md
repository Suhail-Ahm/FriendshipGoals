# HackerEarth Deep Learning challenge: #FriendshipGoals

### PROBLEM OVERVIEW

  Your task is to build a Deep Learning model that analyzes an image of a gathering among friends and classifies them into groups of toddlers, teenagers, or adults.
  
### DATASET

  The dataset consists of images belonging to 3 categories namely toddlers, teenagers, or adults.
  (Have to prepare by using web scrapping)
  
### TRAINING NETWORK
  
  1. Resnet50 works very effectively in success of classifying images between toddlers, teenagers, or adults.
  1. Keras library used to call resnet function.
  1. Nadam algorithm is used for optimization.
  1. Categorical_crossentropy is used as loss function.
